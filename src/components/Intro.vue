      <h1>What is it?!</h1>
      <p>
        The LAWNOTATION project (2022 â€“ 2024) aims to develop an infrastructure
        that allows researchers to making legal data and annotation schemes
        (current and future) accessible for annotation and analysis purposes, to
        develop an annotation platform for analyzing the linguistic and legal
        characteristics of legal documents, and to build a user-friendly
        interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        A team of developers work closely with researchers on the improved
        access to legal materials. The platform is open source and free of use
        for researchers.
      </p>

      <p>
        LAWNOTATION is an initiative of the Digital Legal Studies cluster in the
        Sectorplan Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) - Rechtsgeleerdheid and
        other Dutch universities that are collaboratively working on questions
        related to the digitalisation of law. The research is made possible by
        the Platform Digitale Infrastructuur SSH
