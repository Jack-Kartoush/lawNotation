        The LAWNOTATION project (2022 â€“ 2024) aims to develop an infrastructure that
        allows researchers to making legal data and annotation schemes (current and
        future) accessible for annotation and analysis purposes, to develop an annotation
        platform for analyzing the linguistic and legal characteristics of legal
        documents, and to build a user-friendly interface.
